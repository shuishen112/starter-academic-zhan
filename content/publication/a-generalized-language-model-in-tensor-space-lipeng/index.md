abstract: In this paper, we propose a language model named Tensor Space Language
  Model (TSLM), by utilizing tensor networks and tensor decomposition. In TSLM,
  we build a high-dimensional semantic space constructed by the tensor product
  of word vectors. Theoretically, we prove that such tensor representation is a
  generalization of the n-gram language model. We further show that this
  high-order tensor representation can be decomposed to a recursive calculation
  of conditional probability for language modeling. The experimental results on
  Penn Tree Bank (PTB) dataset and WikiText benchmark demonstrate the
  effectiveness of TSLM.
