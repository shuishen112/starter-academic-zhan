abstract: The recently proposed quantum language model (QLM) aimed at a
  principled approach to modeling term dependency by applying the quantum
  probability theory. The latest development for a more effective QLM has
  adopted word embeddings as a kind of global dependency information and
  integrated the quantum-inspired idea in a neural network architecture. While
  these quantum-inspired LMs are theoretically more general and also practically
  effective, they have two major limitations. First, they have not taken into
  account the interaction among words with multiple meanings, which is common
  and important in understanding natural language text. Second, the integration
  of the quantum-inspired LM with the neural network was mainly for effective
  training of parameters, yet lacking a theoretical foundation accounting for
  such integration. To address these two issues, in this paper, we propose a
  Quantum Many-body Wave Function (QMWF) inspired language modeling approach.
  The QMWF inspired LM can adopt the tensor product to model the aforesaid
  interaction among words. It also enables us to reveal the inherent necessity
  of using Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) in QMWF language modeling.
  Furthermore, our approach delivers a simple algorithm to represent and match
  text/sentence pairs. Systematic evaluation shows the effectiveness of the
  proposed QMWF-LM algorithm, in comparison with the state of the art
  quantum-inspired LMs and a couple of CNN-based methods, on three typical
  Question Answering (QA) datasets.
