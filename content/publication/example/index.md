summary: >
  In this paper, we propose a Quantum Many-body Wave Function (QMWF) inspired
  language modeling approach. The QMWF inspired LM can adopt the tensor product
  to model the aforesaid interaction among words. It also enables us to reveal
  the inherent necessity of using Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) in QMWF
  language modeling. Furthermore, our approach delivers a simple algorithm to
  represent and match text/sentence pairs. Systematic evaluation shows the
  effectiveness of the proposed QMWF-LM algorithm, in comparison with the state
  of the art quantum-inspired LMs and a couple of CNN-based methods, on three
  typical Question Answering (QA) datasets.
